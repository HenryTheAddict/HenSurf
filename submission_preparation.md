feat: Optimize build, enhance tests, and improve performance

This commit introduces several improvements to the HenSurf browser's build process, testing infrastructure, and overall performance configuration.

Build Optimizations:
- Integrated `ccache` into the build process (`scripts/build.sh` and `args.gn`)
  to speed up recompilation by caching build artifacts.
- Added standard Chromium GN flags to `chromium/src/out/HenSurf/args.gn` for
  optimized release builds, including:
  - `is_official_build = true`
  - `symbol_level = 1` (minimal symbols for backtraces)
  - `blink_symbol_level = 0`
  - `treat_warnings_as_errors = false` (for smoother development builds)
  - `enable_nacl = false`
  - `use_jumbo_build = true`
- Enabled ThinLTO (`use_thin_lto = true`) in `args.gn` to improve runtime
  performance and potentially reduce binary size, at the cost of
  increased link times.
- Removed the unused `hensurf_build_optimizations` flag from
  `config/hensurf.gn` as explicit flags are now used.

Testing Enhancements:
- Introduced `scripts/test-hensurf.ps1`, a PowerShell-based test script
  for Windows, providing feature parity with the existing
  `scripts/test-hensurf.sh` for Linux/macOS.
- Added a new test case to both `test-hensurf.sh` and `test-hensurf.ps1`
  to verify that the default homepage is `about:blank`.
- Created `scripts/run_all_tests.py`, a cross-platform test orchestrator
  script. This Python script:
  - Detects the operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows).
  - Executes the appropriate custom test script (`.sh` or `.ps1`).
  - Supports command-line arguments to optionally build and run
    Chromium test suites (e.g., `browser_tests`), including support
    for `gtest_filter` and platform-specific considerations like
    `xvfb-run` on Linux.
  - Provides basic aggregation of test results.

Performance Focus:
- The enabling of ThinLTO directly targets better runtime performance of
  the browser. Other build flags contribute to a smaller and more
  efficient binary.

Cross-Platform Testing Strategy:
- The new `run_all_tests.py` script and the Windows-specific
  `test-hensurf.ps1` significantly improve the ability to test HenSurf
  consistently across Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms.
